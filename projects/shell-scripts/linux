1. checking to see if files exist and then looking for a specific name:

if [ -f /etc/motd ];then
        APP_LINE=`cat /etc/motd | grep Applications:`
        last_result=`echo $?`
        if [ $last_result == "1" ];then
                echo "No Application: line found in /etc/motd"
        else
                APP_NAME=`echo $APP_LINE | awk -F: '{ print $2 }'`
                echo "Application Name: $APP_NAME"
        fi


else
        echo "!!! no etc/motd found"
fi
